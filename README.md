# EEC-289Q-Homework-3-TSP-solver
For the algorithm to find the optimal path for 1000 nodes, I decided to do it in python and use a heuristic approach. The algorithm uses both a Nearest Neighbor construction followed by a 2 Opt Local search improvement. The Nearest Neighbor is used to quickly generate an initial path for the given graph and then the 2 Opt local search is used to refine that path in the given time limit of 60 seconds. The Nearest Neighbor portion chooses a starting node and then continues to pick the closest unvisited neighboring node until all 1000 nodes are visited. Once this process is done the program switches over to the 2 Opt Local search and using the best path generated by the Nearest Neighbor, it checks if reversing the edges optimizes the solution further and if no swap that improves the solution exists or the time runs out, the program returns the best tour cost, the number of cycles executed and saves the final path to a text file. Additionally the timer is set to 50 seconds to ensure that the program executes before the 60 second time limit is met.
